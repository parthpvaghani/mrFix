AR (Augmented Reality) based Instructions on expensive machinery would save money rather than having the experiencing machinery for the first time for the new guy. HoloLens is the right one to leverage this technology to fulfil this requirement of maintenance because it is HMD based device means head mounted device. it provides MR(AR+VR) experience which gives the feel of augmented reality plus virtual reality it presents holograms which is virtual 3d object same like real world physical object gives the feel of actual part of our real world. If persons are sitting in two different location then to show or represent using pen and paper or digital screen may difficult and here HoloLens comes into picture it is having GPU plus HPU and 64 GB storage space plus recording capability which makes it standalone device to carry and move it wherever we wants like field service like it is alone with decent battery life.
